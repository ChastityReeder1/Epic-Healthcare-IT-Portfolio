### **Overview**
This simulation models a hospital registration and Health Information Management (HIM) workflow using **OpenEMR**, mirroring an Epic Prelude environment.  
The goal was to demonstrate patient registration, encounter creation, and record documentation processes from start to finish.

### **Objective**
To show understanding of **Epic Prelude / HIM workflows**, patient intake logic, and documentation accuracy through simulated registration, encounter, and visit activities.

### **Tools & Skills**
OpenEMR • Workflow Analysis • EHR Simulation • Data Entry & Quality Checks • Healthcare Compliance Documentation

### **Deliverables**
- `Prelude_HIM_Workflow_Final.docx` – step-by-step simulation report  
- Screenshots of patient record creation and visit encounter flow (`/Visuals` folder)

### **Outcome**
Demonstrated accurate data capture and understanding of key Prelude/HIM workflow elements, laying the foundation for Epic registration and data integrity principles.
